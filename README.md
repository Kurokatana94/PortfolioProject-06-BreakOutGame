# Break Out

 This project is a Python recreation of the arcade game Breakout, featuring:  
- Multiple rows of colored bricks with increasing speed modifiers.  
- A movable paddle to reflect the ball.  
- Real‑time collision detection and bouncing physics.  
- A “Game Over” pop‑up with **Restart** or **Quit** options when all bricks are destroyed.
